# NPP.PasteRelativePath
Notepad++ Plugin for pasting relative paths (written in C#)

To install, download `NPP.PasteRelativePath.dll` from the release folder and drop it in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins`.  If you have Notepad++ started, you'll have to restart it.

To use, copy a path into your clipboard, open a document, and press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (or Plugins -> NPP.PasteRelativePath -> Paste Relative), and the path pasted will be relative to the currently opened document.
